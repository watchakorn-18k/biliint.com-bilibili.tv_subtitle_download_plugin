# 18/11/2021 UPDATE
Bilibili just update their website, so old version will not be able to get download link.
I have fixed these issue. Please update to the latest version.

Current script issue: Only work in big screen size. If your UI have episode list on the right side of video player, the script will probably work.

New feauture:

## Note
Not the best script, but usable.

There are many "flavor" of biliint site, if they use the same api, this script will problably work.

Change the SUB_LANGUAGE to your desired subtitle language.

If there any problem, open an issue.
